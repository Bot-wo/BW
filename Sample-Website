            Why should I go
         </h2>
        <p>Idaho is great place for tourism. Though it doesn't have any reconizable places to see, it has beautiful scenery and green grass. Not to say to much Idaho has easy to access restuarants and many clean roads to see. Not like other nice states its not terribly expensive to live in or visit. That is why you should atleast go see Idaho and its surroundings.</p>
